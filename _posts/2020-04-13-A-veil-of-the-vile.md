## Prolog
I, firstly, encountered Breaking Bad around high school. And, of course, being a dumb ass back then, I wouldn't be able to comprehend much about it. However, I've been reviewing it recently. Considering Breaking Bad has been such a major part of my life, I thought I should write something to express my deep love and keep a record of some *introspective* ideas. Hopefully, it will be of some help(amusement) to me, or to you. ðŸ˜…

## Ep1: Pilot (9.0 IMDB)
Vince Gilligan was the director & writer of this episode. Before we dive in, a few things about the show should be noted:

- *Almost* every scence probably weighs more than you think.
- Plots are **planted** and interconnected implicitly.

High school chemistry teacher Walter White wakes up at 5 in the morning of his 50th birthday. With a few morning cough, he does exercise in a room full of baby stuff indicates that he's going to have a new child that he did *not* intend.

A close-up of a reward of his contribution to proton radiography. However, it seems he is not very proud of it. Nonetheless, he looks just like a normal teacher except he is not that respected by his students. Even on his birthday party, his *shining* DEA brother-in-law made a fool out of him. Everything is so awkward to Mr.White. 

At a glimpse of a bunch of spilling drug money boxes, he asked the number of them.

It's definitely not just because of the family financial situation (No hot water, vegen bacon, part-time hand-waxing job...)

Walt, personally, have issues with *money*. Gretchen and Elliot, his old friends, created a small company called 'Grey Matter' with walt. They had a really good time back then. But walt sold his share for 5,000 dollars to pay his rent.

He 'left', so says Gretchen[] on which Walt seems to disagree.

Who would've known a little company with a few patents could become one of the most wealthiest in 2008?

Walt could've been a *billionare*.

I believe he is comparing it with the Grey Matter company on which he once gave up in his mind. It's like grudges. Even if years passed, you still couldn't get it out of your mind clean. You always find it somehow somewhere.

He couldn't even have a boner with his wife waxing.

Boring, suppressed life until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Now he had the "probable cause" to do this. He'd been kept it deeply for so long that he almost forgot it was there.

The cancer is a ringing bell, a tongue of flame, a key to the locked cage.

> Pinkman: ...Why do you do it?
> White: **I'm awake.**

Is he really *just* want to leave some money for his family?

Is he really *just* want his children to remember him as a good ol'man and hiddenly provide for them?

He is, partly, doing this for himself for now. Deep down, He thinks, somehow, this business could make up what he'd missed with Grey Matter. He can gain the respect of all. He can "be the man"[said Mike].

Ever since he knows about the cancer, he sticks up like a man more than ever. He had the balls to go to the Captn' Cook(Jess Pinkman). He kicks asses of those laughed at his son.

But it's not enough. 

He lowered his gun eventually.

He didn't even know how to use a gun(almost accidentally shot himself).

Well, it's enough for a boner. LOL.
